# My Advent of Code solutions

I'm currently doing the ["Advent of Code"](https://adventofcode.com/2017) daily coding puzzles and have quite a bit of fun doing them.

While I originally did not plan to make them public, on day 3 I stumbled on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), a website that makes Jupyter Notebooks (One of my favorite coding tools.) hosted in a Github repo available in a hosted, interactive session! 

So, to give this a try while doing my Advent of Code, I started this repo. Not sure yet if I'll add days 1-3, since these do not live in Notebooks yet (and the code's ugly and badly documented), but we'll see.
